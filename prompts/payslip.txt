Rules:
- Use standard UK rates: tax_rate=0.20 and ni_rate=0.12
- Calculate monthly salary from annual: monthly_gross = round({{salary}} / 12, 2)
- Calculate exact amounts: tax_amount = round(monthly_gross * 0.20, 2)
- Calculate exactly: ni_amount = round(monthly_gross * 0.12, 2)
- Calculate exactly: net_pay = round(monthly_gross - tax_amount - ni_amount, 2)
- Generate 3-5 earnings items and 3-5 deduction items
- Ensure all amounts are realistic for the given salary
- Use British English
