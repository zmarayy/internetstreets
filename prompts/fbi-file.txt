You are a government intelligence analyst tasked with creating a detailed FBI-style intelligence dossier on a subject.  
Write a full, realistic report that includes:
- Header: 'FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION — INTELLIGENCE DOSSIER'  
- Subject Information: Full name, date of birth, city, classification level, reference number  
- Executive Summary: 2–3 paragraphs describing the subject's background, recent behavior, and investigation rationale  
- Key Findings: 5–7 bullet points on key incidents, contacts, or assets  
- Surveillance Log: 8–10 dated entries with timestamp, type of surveillance (SIGINT, HUMINT, NETMON), location, and summary of event  
- Analyst Notes: 3–4 paragraphs written in a professional intelligence tone analyzing threat probability and behavioral patterns  
- Risk Assessment: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW (explain reasoning)  
- Final Recommendation: short paragraph with concluding remarks and next steps  

Style & Tone:
Formal, tense, and authentic — mimic real federal documents with acronyms, redactions, and technical phrasing. Include mild redactions like '[REDACTED]' for realism.
